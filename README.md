# Wind Energy Forecasting Project
This project is developed to make accurate and reliable predictions for wind energy production, which is crucial for optimizing renewable energy resources and ensuring sustainable energy supply. To achieve this goal, four distinct models have been employed: XGBoost, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Prophet, and loadable LSTM. Each model offers unique capabilities and advantages, allowing for comprehensive analysis and prediction of wind energy generation patterns. By leveraging the strengths of these diverse models, this project aims to provide valuable insights into wind energy forecasting, facilitating better decision-making processes for energy stakeholders, policymakers, and environmental advocates.

## Description of Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains hourly observations related to wind energy production. Key variables include time, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and power production.

## LSTM Model
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a frequently used deep learning model for modeling sequential data like time series. In this project, the LSTM model has been adapted to make wind energy predictions using time and power columns. Additionally, users can upload their own data and add customized LSTM models for flexibility.
